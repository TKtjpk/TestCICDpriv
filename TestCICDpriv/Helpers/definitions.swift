let Definitions = ["Breakaway Coupling" : "Breakaway Coupling means an LNG bunkering line coupling designed to separate at a pre-determined load to prevent damage to installed LNG transfer equipment; typically incorporate",
                   "Boil-Off Gas (BOG)" : "Boil-Off Gas is the name for the gas which is vaporized due to the heat ingress into the fuel tank.",
                   "Boil-Off Rate (BOR)":"Describes the rate of how many Boil-Off Gas is produced over a certain period.",
                   "Dual Fuel Diesel Engine":"Dual Fuel Diesel Engine is a diesel engine that can burn natural gas as fuel with liquid (pilot) fuel and have the capability of running on liquid fuel only.",
                   "Emergency Release Coupling (ERC)":"Emergency Release Coupling (ERC) ERC means emergency release coupling; typically incorporates a dry-break feature to avoid unwanted LNG release. May be termed PERC for powered emergency release coupling.",
                   "Emergency Shutdown (ESD)":"A system that provides a positive means of quick release of the transfer system and safe isolation of receiving vessel from the supply source.",
                   "Flash Gas":"Boil-off Gas instantly generated during LNG transfer due to the warmer temperature of the receiving ship tanks, sudden pressure drop or friction.",
                   "Gas Consuming Unit (GCU)":"A combustion engine (e. g. boiler) which is used to burn excessive Boil-Off gases.",
                   "Lower Explosive Limit (LEL)":"LEL means the lowest concentration (percentage) of a gas or a vapor in air capable of producing a flash of fire in presence of an ignition source.",
                   "LNG Containment System":"LNG Containment System is the arrangement for containment of LNG including, as applicable, a primary and secondary barrier, associated insulation and any intervening spaces, and adjacent structure if necessary for the support of those elements.",
                   "LNG Spraying":"LNG Spraying means the process whereby LNG liquid is sprayed into the top of a LNG tank to cool the vapor phase and the tank and thereby reduce pressure in the tank.",
                   "Maximum Allowable Relief Valve Setting (MARVS)":"MARVS means Maximum Allowable Relief Valve setting.",
                   "Person in Charge (PIC)":"The Person in Charge (PIC) is a person who is responsible for the overall management of the bunkering operation.",
                   "Purging":"Purging is the process of introducing an inert gas, such as nitrogen, into a LNG tank, hose or piping system already in the inert condition with the objective of further reducing the existing oxygen content and/or reducing the existing hydrocarbon gas content to a level below which combustion cannot be supported if air is subsequently introduced into the system.",
                   "Re-Liquefaction Unit (RLQ)":"A Re-liquefaction Unit is a system used for taking the boil-off gas from LNG tanks and condensing it in a refrigeration system. LNG is then returned to the tanks.",
                   "Safety Zone":"The safety zone is a zone around the bunkering facility, the bunkering station of the receiving ship and the LNG transfer system.",
                   "Security Zone":"The Security Zone is the area around the bunkering facility and receiving ship where ship traffic and other activities are monitored (and controlled) to prevent entry and provide a ‘stand-off’ distance during the bunkering operation; this will be larger than the safety zone.",
                   "Vapour return line":"A vapour return line is a connection between the bunkering facility and the receiving ship to allow excess vapour generated during the bunkering operation to be returned to the bunkering facility and remove any need to vent to atmosphere. It is used to control the pressure in the receiving tank due to the liquid transfer, flash gas and boil-off gas generation."
